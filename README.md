# Fork

This fork exists because upstream isn't maintained anymore. Its goal is to maintain this library in a good state, with mainly bugfixes and possibly minor improvements.

# Description

Dropzone is a JavaScript library that turns any HTML element into a dropzone.
This means that a user can drag and drop a file onto it, and Dropzone will
display file previews and upload progress, and handle the upload for you via
XHR.

It is fully configurable, can be styled according to your needs and is trusted by
thousands.
