* Remove a dependency on `just-extend`: use `Object.assign()` instead
* Simplify greatly the browser detection and remove blockedBrowser code that only targeted opera 12 from 12 years ago

* Some code cleanup: remove unused variables
* Use crypto.randomUUID instead of a custom function
* Run CodeQL only in src/
* Update cypress config

## 6.0.0-beta.2

- Add `binaryBody` support (thanks to @patrickbussmann and @meg1502).
  - This adds full support for AWS S3 Multipart Upload.
  - There is an example setup for this now in `test/test-sites/2-integrations`.

## 6.0.0-beta.1

### Breaking

- Dropzone is dropping IE support! If you still need to support IE, please use
  `5.9.3`. You can download it here:
  https://github.com/dropzone/dropzone/releases/download/v5.9.3/dist.zip
- `Dropzone.autoDiscover` has been removed! If you want to auto discover your
  elements, invoke `Dropzone.discover()` after your HTML has loaded and it will
  do the same.
- The `dropzone-amd-module` files have been removed. There is now a
  `dropzone.js` and a `dropzone.mjs` in the dist folder.
- The `min/` folder has been removed. `dropzone.min.js` is now the only
  file that is minimized.
- Remove `Dropzone.extend` and replace by the `just-extend` package.
- There is no more `Dropzone.version`.

## 5.9.3

- Fix incorrect resize method used for creating thumbnails of existing files
  (thanks to @gplwhite)

## 5.9.2

- Handle `xhr.readyState` in the `submitRequest` function and don't attempt to
  send if it's not `1` (OPENED). (thanks to @bobbysmith007)

## 5.9.1

- Fix the way upload progress is calculated when using chunked uploads. (thanks
  to @ckovey)

## 5.9.0

- Properly handle when timeout is null or 0
- Make the default of timeout null

## 5.8.1

- Fix custom event polyfill for IE11
- Fix build to use ES5 instead of ES6, which was broken due to webpack upgrade.
  (thanks to @fukayatsu)

## 5.8.0

- Dropzone now also triggers custom events on the DOM element. The custom events
  are the same as the events you can listen on with Dropzone but start with
  `dropzone:`. (thanks to @1cg)
- Moved the `./src/options.js` previewTemplate in its own
  `preview-template.html` file.
- Switched to yarn as the primary package manager (shouldn't affect anybody that
  is not working Dropzone itself).

## 5.7.6

- Revert `dist/min/*.css` files to be named `dist/min/*.min.css`.
- Setup bower releases.

## 5.7.5

- Rename `blacklistedBrowsers` to `blockedBrowsers` (but still accept
  `blacklistedBrowsers` for legacy).

## 5.7.4

## 5.7.3 (retracted)

- Add `disablePreviews` option.
- Fix IE problems with Symbols.
- **WARNING**: This release had issues because the .js files couldn't be
  imported as AMD/CommonJS packages properly. The standalone version worked fine
  though. I have retracted this version from npm but have left the release on
  GitHub.

## 5.7.2

- Base the calculation of the chunks to send on the transformed files
- Properly display seconds (instead of ms) in error message when timeout is
  reached

  always assumed that it was a String) (thanks to @almdac)
- Fix orientation on devices that already handle it properly (thanks to @nosegrind)

- Check for `string` in error message type instead of `String` (thanks to @RuQuentin)

## 5.7.1

- Fix issue with IE (thanks to @Bjego)

## 5.7.0

- Cleanup the SVGs used to remove IDs and sketch attributes
  Since SVGs are duplicated this resulted in duplicate IDs being used.
- Add a dedicated `displayExistingFile` method to make it easier to display
  server files.
- Fix an error where chunked uploads don't work as expected when transforming
  files before uploading.

  chunk objects (thanks to @clayton2)
